Additionally, he is a co-founder of Students First New York, the state branch of the national education advocacy organization.</p><span>2005</span><p>A 2005 <i>New York Times</i> article reported that many hedge-fund managers were now writing letters to the SEC demanding executives take specific actions and cited Loeb's letter to Sevin as exemplary of the genre, noting that three weeks after the letter was sent, "Sevin was gone, and a jubilant Mr. Loeb sent out an e-mail message to friends and associates declaring a 'huge victory for Third Point.'"</p><span>2007</span><p>In January 2007, when John Higgins became CEO of Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Loeb bought into the biotech firm to cut its losses and grow revenue.

I think it was a very powerful enforcer early on to like <a href=#>Business</a>."</p><span>2011</span><p>In 2011, 2012, and 2013, Loeb and his wife made significant donations to the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), which funds over 400 Alzheimer's drug discovery programs in academic centers and biotechnology companies in 18 different countries.</p><span>2012</span><p>On May 3, 2012, Loeb revealed that the new CEO of Yahoo!, Scott Thompson, did not have a computer science degree, as had been commonly assumed for many years.

The two worldviews debated the morality of capitalism and free enterprise. In Loeb's presentation, he said he practices Ashtanga yoga and applies yoga principles to his <a href=#>Business</a> and his decision-making.

Seven & I Holdings Co.'s board was planning to replace Ryuichi Isaka as head of the company however, Loeb recommended Isaka as a successor to Toshifumi Suzuki, chairman and chief executive. On April 7, Suzuki resigned after losing a boardroom dispute with Loeb. Loeb wrote in a March 27, 2016 letter to Seven & I <a href=#>Directors</a>, "Mr. Isaka should be rewardedâ€”not demotedâ€”for his performance and commitment to delivering results for shareholders... This isnâ€™t a dynasty. This is a corporation."
