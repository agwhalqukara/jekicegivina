Its Not even good AI. you can tell its not DMX.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Another wrote: “DMX has been dead for awhile & his label is releasing songs made with AI, that’s such a shame.”</p><p>Someone else said: “AI DMX with an accent is hilarious and sad at the same time.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>DMX's label is releasing new DMX songs made with AI on Spotify…</p><p>bro this is so disrespectful, especially when the artist isnt even alive anymore <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ROv8DGdc0J</a></p><p>— Greenuxx (@Greenuxxx) <a href=#>December 18, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>DMX has been dead for awhile & his label is releasing songs made with AI, that’s such a shame. 🤦🏽‍♂️</p><p>— Lil Zazzy ✭ (@LilZazzy223) <a href=#>December 18, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>AI DMX with an accent is hilarious and sad at the same time. 😂 <a href=#>https://t.co/ga89kTv7Nc</a></p><p>— Myles, Is this easy mode? (@MowzaProduction) <a href=#>December 19, 2023</a></p><p>Another posthumous DMX album has been speculated about given the large amount of music he left behind following his death in 2021.</p><p><a class=underline-link href=#>Swizz Beatz recently commented on the prospect of a second posthumous album</a> following 2021’s Exodus, which was actually recorded under X’s direction before his untimely passing.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Speaking to HipHopDX said, the Ruff Ryders producer said: “We have other songs. Can we make a new X album? For sure. Will I make another X album? I don’t know. It has to feel good.”</p><p>Swizz also spoke about the softer direction of <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Exodus</a> compared to previous DMX albums: “He was like, ‘Yo, I don’t wanna shoot up and kill everybody in a verse — that’s not what I’m doing.’ He was preparing to go to the next level and do TV shows and he was preparing to graduate his brand.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/12/dmx-son-performs-x-gon-give-it-to-ya-piano-cover-on-late-rappers-53rd-birthday-250x142.jpg alt="DMX's 7-Year-Old Son Performs 'X Gon' Give It To Ya' Piano Cover On Late Rapper's Birthday" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>DMX's 7-Year-Old Son Performs 'X Gon' Give It To Ya' Piano Cover On Late Rapper's Birthday</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>December 18, 2023</p></a><p>He added: “And so this is why he refrained from doing a bunch of aggressive songs […] It was just a different vibe. This is the music that X really listened to that people don’t know. They think he was just listening to ‘shoot ’em up, bang, bang’ music all day.</p><p>“I never heard him listening to that type of music; I always heard X listening to old classics, amazing music. And I felt that he was at a point in his life where he was like, ‘I want to change up the energy.’”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>DMX returned to the charts earlier this year thanks to <a href=# rel=noopener>Lil Wayne</a>‘s single <a href=#>” rel=”noopener” target=”_blank”>”Kant Nobody,”</a> which heavily samples X’s “N-ggaz Done Started Something.”</p><p>The track peaked at No. 66 on the Billboard Hot 100 while also cracking the top 20 on the Hot Rap Songs chart.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mibprBdlrZuvM6sq6GtnaTCtHnMrqqim12kwrW%2BwKCc</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./eva-mendes-and-ryan-gosling-relationship-timeline-from-their-first-date-wedding-to-children.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eva Mendes and Ryan Gosling relationship timeline: From their first date &amp;amp; wedding to children">&larr;
